This repository contains the hardware performance counter data we collected
and analyzed for the work:

Baljit Singh, Dmitry Evtyushkin, Jesse Elwell, Ryan Riley, and Iliano Cervesato, "On the Detection of Kernel-Level Rootkits Using Hardware Performance Counters", Proceedings of the *ACM Asia Conference on Computer and Communications Security* (ASIACCS), Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates, April 2017.

It is our hope in releasing it that others will be able to improve on our
results.
